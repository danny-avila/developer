Develop a RESTful API in Python using the Flask web framework. This API will serve as an interface to various AI utility libraries, handling user credentials securely for accessing these AI services.

    Setting up the Environment
    Start by setting up a Python environment. Install Flask, and the necessary AI libraries using pip. Ensure these dependencies are listed in a requirements.txt file for easier future setup.

    Create a New Flask Application
    In a new file named app.py, initialize a Flask application. Structure your application according to best practices, considering modularity, maintainability, and scalability.

    Data Input/Output
    Implement handling of expected payloads. This API will only serve as a service, so no database or CRUD operations will be necessary. You will receive requests as follows: curl -X 'POST' \
    'http://localhost:8080/ask' \
    -H 'accept: application/json' \
    -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    -d '{
    "input": "How many people live in canada as of 2023?",
    "envs": {
        "OPENAI_API_KEY": "'"${OPENAI_API_KEY}"'",
    }
    }'

    Define API Endpoints
    Each endpoint should correspond to a function or feature provided by one of the AI utility libraries. Ensure your endpoints are logically organized and clearly named according to the function they perform. You should use appropriate HTTP methods for each endpoint, commonly GET for retrieving data, POST for sending data, and PUT/PATCH for updating data.

    For example, if one of your AI libraries performs sentiment analysis, you might have an endpoint like POST /sentiment_analysis that accepts text data and returns the sentiment score.

    API Endpoints Implementation
    Implement the functionality for each endpoint using the corresponding AI library. Ensure to handle possible errors, and return meaningful error messages when something goes wrong. Make sure to validate and sanitize user input to protect your API from malicious use.

    Response Formatting
    Structure your response data in a consistent, logical way. It's common practice to return JSON data from an API, with a status code, a message (especially for errors), and the data itself. The expected data format is:
    ```json
    {
    "result": "Arrr, there be 38,645,670 people livin' in Canada as of 2023!",
    "error": "",
    "stdout": "Answer the following questions as best you can, but speaking as a pirate might speak...Final Answer: Arrr, there be 38,645,670 people livin' in Canada as of 2023!"
    }
    ```

    Testing
    Write tests for your endpoints to ensure they work as expected. Consider edge cases and invalid inputs for thorough testing.

    Dockerize API server
    You will need to write a working Dockerfile with all the setup steps and a corresponding docker-compose.yaml file with all for convenience of setting up this API.

    Documentation
    Document your API thoroughly. For each endpoint, explain the URL, HTTP method, expected input, possible error messages, and example output. This information will be invaluable for developers using your API.

Remember, the key to a good API is consistency and clarity. Users should be able to predict endpoint URLs and understand responses based on their knowledge of the rest of the API.
